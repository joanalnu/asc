                <p>The Arnold Sommerfeld Center for Theoretical Physics (ASC) is marking its 20th anniversary this year. Established on November 5, 2004, and officially opened on January 19, 2005, the ASC has emerged as an internationally recognized hub for theoretical physics. This significant achievement has substantially enhanced the reputation of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich as a leading center in this field.</p>

                <p>The ASCâ€™s mission is to seamlessly integrate cutting-edge research with exceptional scientific education, paying homage to its namesake, Arnold Sommerfeld. Sommerfeld, a pioneering figure in modern theoretical physics, established a renowned center in Munich in the early 20th century. His contributions extended to the development of atomic theory, and he mentored numerous Nobel laureates and prominent physicists, including Hans Bethe, Peter Debye, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli.</p>

                <p>Over the past two decades, the ASC has faithfully upheld this legacy by organizing workshops, lecture series, PhD schools, and a diverse array of courses in theoretical physics. The center has welcomed esteemed guests, including Nobel Prize winners such as David Gross, Anthony Leggett, and Frank Wilczek, as well as Fields Medalists like Alain Connes, Edward Witten, and Shing-Tung Yau.</p>

                <p>Each year, approximately 100 PhD students from across the globe participate in the doctoral schools. And enowned speakers like Juan Maldacena deliver special lectures.</p>
