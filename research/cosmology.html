<h1>Cosmology @ ASCTP</h1>
<p>Cosmology is the branch of astrophysics that studies the Universe as a unity, its origin, evolution, composition and fate. At the ASC Center for Theoretical Physics we focus on inflation theories, the Theory of Recombination and the Crisis in Cosmology - also known as Hubble Tension.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also are part of the LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA Collaboration, DESI Collaboration, EUCLID Consortium, and Cosmic Probe Telescope.</p>
