            <h2>Scientific Activities</h2>
            <p>The ASC is open to proposals for scientific activities including workshops, thematic programs, conferences and schools. Generally, they should consist of a period of time up to three months of concentrated activity in a specific area of current research in theoretical physics. Typically, they should include opportunities for engaging graduate students, such as graduate courses and easy access to long-term visitors.</p>


            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>The proposal shall be sent per <a href="mailto:luest.dieter@physik.uni-muenchen.de">email</a> and must contain the following information:</h3>

            <h2>Sommerfeld Lecture Series</h2>
            <p>The Sommerfeld Lecture Series brings renowned theoretical physics from around the world to the ASC to give 3 lectures. The first one oriented to a general audience, the second intended as a colloquium, and the third for a specialized public.</p>
            <p>The ASC designates lectureres based on their outstanding contributions to the advancemenet of theoretical physics, excellence in research and strong presentation skills.</p>
